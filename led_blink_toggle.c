  ðŸ§ª How to Check the Result in MPLAB X Simulator (PIC18F4550):

  1. Open MPLAB X, build the project with XC8.
  2. Go to: Window > Target Memory Views > SFRs.
  3. Find and monitor `LATB` under PORTB group.
  4. Click Debug > Debug Project (F5) to start simulation.
  5. Use "Pause" to freeze execution at any time.
  6. Youâ€™ll observe LATB toggling between 0x00 and 0xFF repeatedly.
     â†’ This simulates LED blinking ON and OFF for all 8 bits on PORTB.

  ðŸ”§ Tip: You can also simulate time-based blinking better by setting breakpoints or stepping over in MPLAB X.
